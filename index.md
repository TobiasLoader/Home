## Welcome to TobiasLoader

Here are my top six repositories up to date... 

#### 1. Neural-Network-P5

I originally wrote a python supervised learning neural network over Christmas 2018, and converted *[it](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Neural-Network-P5)* to P5 to be able to include a UI from which the user could determine properties of the network, such as number of hidden layers and nodes per layer.

#### 2. 3D-Engine

My *[3D Engine](https://tobiasloader.github.io/3D-Engine)* was my main summer 2018 project. By this point in my education I had only covered GCSE/FSMQ mathematics, and so didn't realise that I could do much of what I'd been working on for the past few weeks and months in a few simple matrice equations. Nevertheless I had a lot of fun writing it and I consider it my first major project, and a piece of work of which I'm proud.

#### 3. Ray-Tracer

Soon after finishing my 3D-Engine in Autumn 2018 – and being still interested in representing a 3D world on a 2D screen – I launched into yet another large project. I'd heard of these *[Ray Tracer's](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Ray-Tracer)* which represented very realistic images of a 3D screen by use of light rays. So I set out to write my own!

#### 4. Particle-Physics-Simulator

Inspired in a Particle Physics lesson in Spring 2019, I decided to *[simulate (sub-atomic) particles](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Particle-Physics-Simulator)* interacting with each other, keeping track of the various forces felt by each one. 

#### 5. Dove-Hawk-Marketplace

After having watched a Youtube video on the topic by Primer in Summer 2019, I wanted to simulate my own *[marketplace](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Dove-Hawk-Marketplace)* and have the freedom to play around for myself. This tied in nicely with previous work I'd done on modelling predators with differential equations.

#### 6. Fourier-Transforms

In Summer/Autumn 2019, we began revisiting complex numbers and Eulers form in Further Maths at school. This lead me to rediscover Fourier Transforms, something I'd found before but hadn't previously had the knowledge to fully understand. I decided to try to simulate what was going on behind the scenes, and came up with this *[Fourier-Transforms](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Fourier-Transforms)*.

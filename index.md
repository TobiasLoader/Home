## Here are some of my best repositories to date... 


#### [1. Neural-Network-P5](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Neural-Network-P5)

I originally wrote a python supervised learning neural network over Winter 2018, and converted *[the network to P5](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Neural-Network-P5)* in Spring 2019, as I wanted to be able to include a UI. The user can now determine certain properties of the network, such as the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes per layer.

#### [2. 3D-Engine](https://tobiasloader.github.io/3D-Engine)

This *[3D Engine](https://tobiasloader.github.io/3D-Engine)* was my main summer 2018 project. At this stage of my education I'd only covered GCSE/FSMQ mathematics, and so didn't realise that much of what I'd been working on for the past few weeks and months could be done in a few simple matrice equations. Nevertheless I had a lot of fun writing the engine and I consider it my first major project, a piece of work of which I'm proud.

#### [3. Ray-Tracer](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Ray-Tracer)

Soon after finishing my 3D-Engine in Autumn 2018 – and being still interested in representing a 3D world on a 2D screen – I launched into yet another large project. I'd heard of these *[Ray Tracer's](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Ray-Tracer)* which drew more realistic images of a 3D scene using virtual light rays. So I set out to write my own!

#### [4. Particle-Physics-Simulator](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Particle-Physics-Simulator)

Inspired in a Particle Physics lesson in Spring 2019, I decided to *[simulate how (sub-atomic) particles](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Particle-Physics-Simulator)* interact with each other, making sure to keep track of the forces felt by each one.

#### [5. Dove-Hawk-Marketplace](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Dove-Hawk-Marketplace)

After having watched a Youtube video on the topic by Primer in Summer 2019, I wanted to simulate my own *[marketplace](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Dove-Hawk-Marketplace)* and have the freedom to play around for myself. This tied in nicely with previous work I'd done on modelling predators with differential equations on Desmos.

#### [6. Fourier-Transforms](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Fourier-Transforms)

As I started Y13 in Summer/Autumn 2019, we began revisiting complex numbers and Eulers form in further maths. This lead me to rediscover Fourier Transforms, something I'd been interseted in before but didn't previously have the knowledge to fully understand. I decided to try to simulate what was going on behind the scenes, and came up with this *[Fourier-Transforms](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Fourier-Transforms)*.

#### [7. GraFx](https://tobiasloader.github.io/GraFx)

In Autumn 2018, I realised that although Desmos was great and I used it all the time, I sometimes would want greater freedom to graph specific functions and arithmetic/geometric series etc... So I came up with my own graphing calculator: *[GraFx](https://tobiasloader.github.io/GraFx)*.
